# Social Feed app

Next.js app that showcase how to use the [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) framework along with [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm) to seed and query a SQLite DB. It is a nice combo to build a fullstack app with a single language (TypeScript) and a single framework. It provides full type safety and a great developer experience.
